# Forecasting-of-energy-of-ferright-trains
that was used in my thesis to forecast the energy of trains 
the work was divided mainly into 2 parts. The first was Data framing and preprcoessing. The second was using ML models.
In data framing and preprcoessing, the main target was to create one data file which contains cleaned up features and targets. 
then model reduction using pca and moving outilers using IQR was implemented.
later different Ml models were implemented
As a last step clusstering was implemnted for future work
